- 🌱 I’m currently learning additional international and national law and human rights law.I was a, contracted, United Nations war crimes investigator in the, Balkans. Now seeking work
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on these and other areas including getting countries to share intelligence with all others to safeguard all humanity. I'm good at it. Not, only between western allies. It's vital for even, Iran, to share intelligence with, NATO, I've already shown this is possible.
